# Random Pokemon Encounter

This challenge requires you to perform a very common task in web development - get data from an API and display it with your HTML.  

You can practice the first part and make sure you understand it with the Pokemon Data challenge. Once you have done that, it's time to give your JS object and DOM manipulation skills some practice by displaying the data in a meaningful way on a web page. 

The HTML provided is expecting these pieces of data to be displayed properly:

The Pokemon's name

The Pokemon's type(s) 

You should have conditional rendering -- if a Pokemon has 1 type, show 1 div. If it has 2 types, show 2 divs.

The Pokemon's image or sprite

A really basic solution may look like this:



You can use your code from the Pokemon Data challenge to fetch the data in the getPokemonData function. In this challenge, you will also update the showPokemonData function to display the information on the web page as indicated above.

There are no tests for this challenge - just verify your own results and submit to allow instructors to see your attempts.

## Bonus fun!

If that seemed too easy, or you would like to expand your learning with some more challenges, try these:

Use AJAX instead of fetch to get the data

Modify your solution so that it grabs 6 Pokemon and shows them all in your HTML.

Style the page based on the Pokemon you're encountering. eg. Pokemon types have colours associated with them (eg. water type = blue colour). Use that in some of the divs or other elements when displaying the Pokemon.

# Warning

## Warning!

In index.html, there is a div with id `warning` and a button with id `makeItRed`.

Your task is to make the background of the the warning div red when the button is clicked. Add code to the script.js file to do this.

Hint: You can set style directly on a DOM node using the style property. For example:

ele.style.color = "blue"

where ele is a node in the DOM.

## Bonus!

Make changes so that the user can toggle the red background by clicking the button:


When the user clicks the button that says "Make It Red!", the background of the div should change to red, and the text on the button should change to something else - like "Clear warning".

When the background of the div is red, and the button has the alternate text ("Clear warning"), when the user clicks the button, the background colour should be cleared from the div, and the button text should go back to saying "Make It Red!".

# Stash kitty

In the scaffold, there is a picture of a cute cat, and a moustache.

Your task is to implement an event listener that will put the moustache where the user clicks, so you can give the cute cat a moustache.


Implement the scaffolded function in script.js to accomplish this, and use the function in an event listener.

Some tips:

- Two event properties that will help here are pageX and pageY. These return coordinates of the mouse. Use console.log to see what is returned.
- Two style properties you can use are style.top and style.left, although you could find another way to place the moustache. Note that you have to include units when you set these properties.

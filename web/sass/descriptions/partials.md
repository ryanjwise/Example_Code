# Partials

You can create partial Sass files that contain little snippets of `CSS` that you can include in other Sass files. This is a great way to modularize your `CSS` and help keep things easier to maintain. A partial is a Sass file named with a leading underscore. You might name it something like `_partial.scss`. The underscore lets Sass know that the file is only a partial file and that it should not be generated into a CSS file. Sass partials are used with the `@use` rule.

See [Modules](./modules.md) for an example.
